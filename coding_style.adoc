== C++ naming conventions

- Naming convention is defined by `clang-tidy` config file which can be found in `https://github.com/cppfw/tool-configs` repo.
- factory functions must use word `make` (not `create`, etc.). E.g. `make_object(param1, param2)`.
- When variable name clashes with type name, then the variable name should have a `_v` suffix.

== C++ code formatting

Code formating is defind by `clang-format` config file which can be found in `https://github.com/cppfw/tool-configs` repo.
